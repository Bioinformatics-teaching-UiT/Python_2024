# create a list named 'numbers' with the integers 1 to 8

# add 9 to the end of the list

# add the extension to the end of your numbers list


# print out an informative message that gives the number of 
# elements in the list, and then the list itself
# no hard coding! (don't count in your head and print it, 
# have the code count for you)



# here is a list, can you print out how many times 'dog' occurs?
animals = ['cat', 'rat', 'mouse', 'dog', 'giraffe', 'dog']




# insert a moose at the first position of the animals list



# using the remove() method, remove 'dog' - 

# check the list - is this the behaviour you expect?

# pop out the 3rd element, what do you get?



# reverse the animal list


# clear the animal list, what do you get?
