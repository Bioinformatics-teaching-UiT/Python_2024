In this exercise you will practice with dictionary methods

Follow the instructions below
"""

# make a dictionary that called number_names that stores as 
# keys the numbers from 1 to 5 in words, and as values the integers themselves
# so, an example of an entry would be where the key is 'two' and the value is 2


# get the value corresponding to the key 'two'




# get a list of all the keys in this dictionary


# delete the last entry of the number_names




# remove the 'two' entry



# count the number of entries and print this out
# again, do this programmatically! we are not testing if you can count ;)


# delete all the values from the dictionary, what do you get?
